utsbasic is a port of bxbasic(2003) era.  It is a beta release more
for testing and bug finding.  A large number of test programs are included.

utsbasic runs under UTS under VM370.


Thi is a start/working in progress.  I will update this file as
I make progress.  utsbasic will run all the test programs, so you
can play around with it.

The documentation manual is the original BXBASIC.  Over time it will be
updated to reflect UTSbasic.

Comments/bug issues, please.  I will try and address them as quick
as possible.

Cheers


Install

copy all .c programs up to UTS.  I use the /home directory and created a 
subdirectory utsbasic.  

cuts is a script to compile the utsbasic system.  you may have to chmod cuts to 
777 for it to run.

test.txt is a data file that BX16 programs use for testing.
