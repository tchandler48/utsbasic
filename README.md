utsbasic is a port of bxbasic(2003) era.  It is a beta release more
for testing and bug finding.  A large number of test programs are included.

utsbasic runs under UTS under VM370.


Thi is a start/working in progress.  I will update this file as
I make progress.  utsbasic will run all the test programs, so you
can play around with it.

Comments/bug issues, please.  I will try and address them as quick
as possible.

Cheers
